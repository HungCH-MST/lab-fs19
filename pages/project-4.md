description: Model Parts and Assembly of a Drone Using SolidWorks

## Objective

<img src="../assets/images/project-4/drone-asm.jpg" width="700">

The motor and propeller models (NX 12 `.prt` files) are provided which you can use for assembly modeling in Task 2. *Note that the motor and the propeller are modeled only for assembly purpose, which are highly simplified, they are not functionally modeled.* 

<img src="../assets/images/project-1/motor-asm.png" width="700">

- [motor.prt](../assets/models/project-1/motor.prt)
- [propeller.prt](../assets/models/project-1/propeller.prt)
- [motor-propeller.prt](../assets/models/project-1/motor-propeller.prt)



In this project, you will be modeling four parts of a drone using NX, and then assemble them together. These four parts are show below:

These four parts will construct the body frame of a drone. Let's take a look:

</div>

The models created in Solidworks 2017 are also provided. The Solidworks files contain my modeling history, feel free to use it as reference, but remember to be creative, there's got to be a better way to achieve the same geometry in CAD.

- [base_top.SLDPRT](../assets/models/project-1/base_top.SLDPRT)
- [base_bottom.SLDPRT](../assets/models/project-1/base_bottom.SLDPRT)
- [arm.SLDPRT](../assets/models/project-1/arm.SLDPRT)
- [leg.SLDPRT](../assets/models/project-1/leg.SLDPRT)



***Let me know if you have any issues on loading the provided models. Issues may happen because of the version conflict.***

## Notes

- This is an ***SolidWorks*** project, so model the parts in ***NX***.
- The unit of the provided model is ***mm***.
- It is not required to have exactly the same dimensions with the provided models. But make sure that your model have the similar features.
- There're some crutial dimensions related to **mate** which you need to keep them consistent for different parts. Make sure that the four parts can be assembled as shown above without interference.

## What to submit?

This project consists of two tasks: 

- Model the the necessary parts and assemble the drone, then submit the whole 4 part files (`.prt`) and the assembly file (`.prt`) in a .zip file. **Due: Nov. 2**

## How to submit?

- Submit your project to the corresponding module on Canvas (use your last name to name the file (e.g. Lastname_Project1_Part1). Do not use generic names like project1).
