## Objective

Designing and modeling of a sport water bottle.

## Notes

1. Design a sport water bottle (below are some pictures to help you).
2. Use surface features in NX (such as curves and surfaces) to model it.
3. You do NOT need to model the cap in a separate file.
4. You do NOT need to design a complex part; something similar to the examples is enough.
5. All dimensions must be in **millimeters**.

Model the body, then submit the body part file (`.prt`) in a .zip file. **Due: Oct. 5**

## How to submit?

- Submit your project to the corresponding module on Canvas (use your last name to name the file (e.g. Lastname_Project1). Do not use generic names like project1).
