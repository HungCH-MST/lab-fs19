## Objective

Designing and modeling of a BODY for a drone.

## Notes

1. Design a BODY for the drone based on its inner frame. A simplified model of the droneâ€™s frame is shown below and can be downloaded from Canvas. The BODY should be able to envelop the given frame except necessary openings for motors, stand legs, etc. The approximate design space is shown in Fig. 2.
2. You can search the Internet for inspirations.
3. Use **surface modeling** in NX to model it.



## What to submit?

Model the body, then submit the body part file (`.prt`) in a .zip file. **Due: Oct. 5**

## How to submit?

- Submit your project to the corresponding module on Canvas (use your last name to name the file (e.g. Lastname_Project1_Part1). Do not use generic names like project1).
